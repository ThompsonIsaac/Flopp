# Flopp
The code for Flopp - a WebGL game - https://shufflesninja.itch.io/flopp

This was my first attempt at a full Unity3D game. The game is a spin-off of Bloxorz. The player is a 1x1x2 rectangular prism who can move around a grid by changing orientation. The goal is to orient the block such that it stands up on the goal tile. There are several obstacles that make this more difficult, such as disappearing tiles, tiles that the player cannot stand on vertically, buttons, and a phantom that chases the player.

I have learned a lot about object oriented programming and good coding practice by making this game. These skills have manifested more apparently in my subsequent project, I Take Stew - https://github.com/ThompsonIsaac/I-Take-Stew
